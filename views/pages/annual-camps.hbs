Camp is a comprehensive, fast-paced, one day pitching camp held at RBI every year since 2015. The focus of the camp is on pitching mechanics, routines, armcare and mindset. Players will have an opportunity to work with Daniel and the rest of RBI's Pitching Staff on various drills and fundamentals. At the conclusion of camp, Daniel will throw and talk through his first bullpen of the year, putting principles into practice for everyone to see. Camp will be followed by an autograph session and gear giveaway.</p>
